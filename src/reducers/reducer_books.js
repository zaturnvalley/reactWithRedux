      pages: 601, 
      about: `East of Eden is a novel by Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck, published in September 1952. 
            Often described as Steinbeck\'s most ambitious novel, East of Eden brings to life the intricate details of two families, 
            the Trasks and the Hamiltons, and their interwoven stories. The novel was originally addressed to Steinbeck\'s young sons, 
            Thom and John (then 6 and 4 years old, respectively). Steinbeck wanted to describe the Salinas Valley for them in detail: 
            the sights, sounds, smells, and colors.
            The Hamilton family in the novel is said to be based on the real-life family of Samuel Hamilton, Steinbeck's maternal grandfather. 
            A young John Steinbeck also appears briefly in the novel as a minor character.
            According to his third and last wife, Elaine, Steinbeck considered it his magnum opus. Steinbeck stated about East of Eden: 
            "It has everything in it I have been able to learn about my craft or profession in all these years." He further claimed: 
            "I think everything else I have written has been, in a sense, practice for this."`,

      pages: 824,
      about: `The Brothers Karamazov, also translated as The Karamazov Brothers, is the final novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky. 
            Dostoyevsky spent nearly two years writing The Brothers Karamazov, which was published as a serial in The Russian Messenger from 
            January 1879 to November 1880. The author died less than four months after its publication.
            The Brothers Karamazov is a passionate philosophical novel set in 19th-century Russia, that enters deeply into the ethical debates of God, 
            free will, and morality. It is a spiritual drama of moral struggles concerning faith, doubt, judgment, and reason, set against a modernizing 
            Russia, with a plot which revolves around the subject of patricide. Dostoyevsky composed much of the novel in Staraya Russa, which inspired 
            the main setting. Since its publication, it has been acclaimed as one of the supreme achievements in world literature.`,

    { title: 'Kafka on the Shore', 
      pages: 480,
      about: `A 2002 novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami. Comprising two distinct but interrelated plots, the narrative runs back and forth between 
            both plots, taking up each plotline in alternating chapters. The odd chapters tell the 15-year-old Kafka's story as he runs away from his father's 
            house to escape an Oedipal curse and to embark upon a quest to find his mother and sister. After a series of adventures, he finds shelter in a quiet, 
            private library in Takamatsu, run by the distant and aloof Miss Saeki and the intelligent and more welcoming Oshima. There he spends his days reading 
            the unabridged Richard Francis Burton translation of One Thousand and One Nights and the collected works of Natsume S≈çseki until the police begin inquiring 
            after him in connection with a brutal murder. The even chapters tell Nakata's story. Due to his uncanny abilities, he has found part-time work in his old age 
            as a finder of lost cats (notably, Murakami's earlier work The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle also involves searching for a lost cat). The case of one particular 
            lost cat puts him on a path that ultimately takes him far away from his home, ending up on the road for the first time in his life. He befriends a truck driver 
            named Hoshino, who takes him on as a passenger in his truck and soon becomes very attached to the old man.`,
